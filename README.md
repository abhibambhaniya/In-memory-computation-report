# In-memory-computation-report
The current computing platforms are majorly based on the Von Neumann Bottleneck that contains decoupled Memory and Processor. Running data intensive applications on such systems in the current scenario of Artificial Intelligence boom, Big Data and advent of Internet of Things is limited by the Von-Neumann Bottleneck. Computational Speed for faster training & analysis and Low Power devices for IOT are the major out of many issues with this bottleneck.

Thus innovation in Nanometer Devices or new architectural and circuital designs of the computer are ways that can breakthrough this barrier. One of the most promising approach is In Memory Computation, which aims to embed logic inside the memory for reduced data transfers with less area and power consumption.

The aim of this thesis is to design an Architecture for In-memory Computation such that area is optimised along with substantial amount of operations that can be performed to carry out numerous tasks.
